## Facebook Photos

Leveraging animations and gestures to transition between screens

Time spent: 7 hours

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
- [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
- [ ] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
- [ ] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.



Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I am unable to get the image to be passed through to the photoView... not sure what I am doing wrong.
2. As a result of not getting the image to be passed through, progress stalled for the remaining features. I imagine there is a more clever way of avoiding dependencies like this that prohibit progress, but I am unsure where to start.
